    <h4>AlerTiger: Deep Learning for AI Model Health Monitoring at LinkedIn</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">
      <p><a class="talk-title" href="https://kdd.org/kdd2023/ads-track-papers/" target="_blank">The 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’23), August 6–10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA.</a>: Data-driven companies use AI models extensively to develop products and intelligent business solutions, making the health of these models crucial for business success. Model monitoring and alerting in industries pose unique challenges, including a lack of clear model health metrics definition, label sparsity, and fast model iterations that result in short-lived models and features. As a product, there are also requirements for scalability, generalizability, and explainability. To tackle these challenges, we propose AlerTiger, a deep-learning-based MLOps model monitoring system that helps AI teams across the company monitor their AI models’ health by detecting anomalies in models’ input features and output score over time. The system consists of four major steps: model statistics generation, deep-learning-based anomaly detection, anomaly post-processing, and user alerting. Our solution generates three categories of statistics to indicate AI model health, offers a two-stage deep anomaly detection solution to address label sparsity and attain the generalizability of monitoring new models, and provides holistic reports for actionable alerts. This approach has been deployed to most of LinkedIn’s production AI models for over a year and has identified several model issues that later led to significant business metric gains after fixing. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/frankxu/kdd2023-poster-alertiger" target="_blank">(slides)</a></p>

    <h4>Inferring Social Media Users' Mental Health Status</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">
      <p><a class="talk-title" href="https://midas.umich.edu/event/learning-analytics-challenge-symposium/" target="_blank">MIDAS Learning Analytics Challenge Symposium, Ann Arbor, May 2018</a>: Talk about the research on inferring mental health status by analyzing social media posts from the machine-learning point of view. Covers the internals of multi-model features, machine learning model performances, how to interpret the useful signals. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/frankxu/inferring-social-media-users-mental-health-status-from-multimodal-information" target="_blank">(slides)</a></p>
