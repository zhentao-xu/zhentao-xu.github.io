excerpt: Open Source Reading

Starting from today I am going to start reading 50 open source project. 

##### Why?
The reason is because I noticed that comparing to those engineers who are senior than me (staff-plus engineer), one of their strength is that they can fluently leverage the programming tools, including language suger, and advanced features (e.g. context manager, generator) to write fancy while easy-to-use software. At the same time, understanding open-source project can help me build the bridge between the pure programming language and the final product behavior, enhancing my craft.


##### How?

I plan to start from simpler project (simple means easy code structure with smaller lines of codes) and popular project (#stars > 10K). the paces can be 1 project each week.

I should think about the following questions during reading:
1. **language feature** what languague syntac suger / programming language's features are used in this project.
2. **architecture** how this project is architectured, ideally using one figure to represent it.
3. **file structure** how the code files are organized in this project.

I also need to think that **if I want to build such a project, how I will make it? how to improve on top**.
